        <p>I'm Humberto Godinez. Currently, I'm a<strong> Delivery Lead</strong> at Arundo Analytics leading teams of data scientists, solution architects, software engineers, and field engineers to scope, develop and operationalize state-of-the-art machine learning and other analytical SaaS solutions. Before joining Arundo, I worked as a Data Scientist Specialist in the Business Development area of QRI, an Oil and Gas value creation company. As a Data Scientist within QRI, I worked on big data analytics and machine learning projects, as well as economic modelling and risk evaluation for both National Oil Companies and Asset Managment Firms. Previously, I served as a Quantitative Advisor (Data Scientist) to the CFO and the Risk Managing Director of Pemex. During my 10 year career at Pemex, I was responsible for developing models to forecast energy prices, tariffs, the P&ampL statement, and the evaluation of strategic projects. I also led a division for procurement optimization of one of the business lines of the Company.

        <p>I hold a <strong>PhD in Mathematics</strong> from <strong>The Institute for Financial and Actuarial Mathematics</strong> of The University of Liverpool. I also studied Actuarial Sciences and Applied Mathematics, a Master in Public Management. I am a Microsoft Certified Azure Data Scientist, in addition to certifications in Financial Management (Cornell University), Econometric Modelling (ITAM) and Data Sciences (The Data Incubator). Currently, I am pursuing the Master of Computer Sciences at Georgia Tech. My research agenda during my PhD was focused on the important subject of designing pension systems that are financially sustainable during a period of ageing risks. I believe my work and the emerging results have considerable practical and policy-making significance at national and international levels.
